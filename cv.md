### About myself:

I have a main job in construction/engineering. IT is my hobby, to which I devote all my free time, at least 30 hours per week. I have a desire to create an application with a customer database. The idea is not new, but I'm interested in understanding the client side, server side, database interaction. There is still a lot to learn, but everything is bound to turn out.
